This dataset contain some medical information of patients which tells whether that person getting a heart attack chance is yes or no. 

Using the information explore the dataset and classify the target variable using different Machine Learning models and findout the accuracy and which algorithm suitable for this dataset.

This dataset has 303 rows and 14 features.The data type of all features are numeric.

steps:

Data preprocessing:

                  Remove the duplicate row

                  Apply Feature scaling type Standardization

Model selection and Training:

                  LogisticRegression

                  Naive Bayes Classifier

Model evaluation:

                  Confusion matrix

                  Classification report
